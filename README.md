# BlissDraw

A small drawing program intended to help me learn TypeScript. Users can draw on a web canvas, change the size and colour of their lines as well as changing their background colour - once they're happy with their work, users can also export their work as a PNG. Some planned features for the future include MP3 file uploads, so users can listen to music while they draw.

# Running Instructions

To run the program, download this repository, then run npx tsc in your command line.
